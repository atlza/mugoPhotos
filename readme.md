## Installation

If you already have a hugo site on your machine, you can simply add this theme via

```

Then, adjust the `config.toml` as detailed below.


For more information read the official [setup guide][hugo-setup-guide] of Hugo.

## Content & structure

### Starting fresh

If you are starting fresh, simply copy over the contents of the `exampleSite`-directory included in this theme to your source directory. That should give you a good idea about how things work, and then you can go on from there to make the site your own.

### Adding content

You can add **a new section to the homepage** via running

```
hugo new homepage/my-new-content.md
```

To create **a page separate from the homepage**, run

```
hugo new my-new-page.md
```
